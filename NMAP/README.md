## Use the tool NMAP [Command line only]to perform the below task. Run Wireshark in the background and capture only the necessary packets to showcase for the corresponding question.
a) Explain the subnet and use the NMAP Command to scan the services for the whole subnet.
A subnet, short for subnetwork, is a logical subdivision of an IP network. It allows for the division of a larger network into smaller, manageable parts. Subnetting is primarily used to improve network performance, security, and organization. Each device on a network is assigned an IP address, and subnetting helps in efficient routing of data packets within the network.

Command to scan entire subnet `nmap -sV <subnet/CIDR notation>`
