### Scanning the machine with NMAP

Use `nmap -sV <IP>` to probe open ports to determine service/version info

We can see that there many services let's take any two and try to exploit it.
First go with vsftpd 2.3.4 lets search in metasploit database using the search command

So there is exploit for this lets select that exploit

We have selected the payload let see the options

After setting the host, running the command we were able to get root shell access into the metasploit system

Samba is running on port 139 and 445 so we will use a samba based exploit next

So we can see that we are in the target machine a we have full access.
